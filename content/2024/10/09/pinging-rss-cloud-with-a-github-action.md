A lot has changed since I last [wrote](https://scotthanson.de/archives/2022/11/23/pinging-rsscloud-with-a-static-blog) about RSSCloud. I now host my blog myself on [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com/) instead of using Netlify. The blog now consist of static files generated by a nuxt.js app based on bloggrify. My simple setup no longer can ping RSSCloud itself when it changes. However, since I still push updates through GitHub, I can run a GitHub action every time I push to my repository.

```yaml
name: Ping RSSCloud

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main

jobs:
    ping-rsscloud:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Ping RSSCloud
              run: |
                  curl -X POST "http://rpc.rsscloud.io:5337/ping" \
                  -d "url=https://scotthanson.de/rss.xml"
```

And that's all! RSSCloud sends a success message in response, but since the GitHub Action doesn't have server running, no one is listening. And, of course, this post is also to test whether the ping is working. ðŸ˜ƒ
