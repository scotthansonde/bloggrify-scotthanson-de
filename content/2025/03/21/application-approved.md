If you were holding your breath waiting for the result of my [application for German citizenship](https://scotthanson.de/2024/10/27/documents-for-german-citizenship-application-scotts-version), you can start breathing again. ðŸ˜ƒ

The appointment to submit the documents I had collected was quite anti-climatic. I simply handed them over one by one, keeping the originals, and that was it. I was told that processing would take 6 to 9 months. So I waited.

Last week, after 5 months and 20 days, I received an mail that my application was approved. An appointment to pick up my citizenship certificate was proposed for the first week of April, which was accepted. I need to bring a form, my passport, and my visa card (which will be given up).

Presumably my next steps after that will be to apply for German ID and passport so I can travel out of the country.
